    <h1>Tissue Engineering and Organ Regeneration</h1>
    <h2>Goal of the Subject</h2>
    <p>Engineer treatments for medical problems</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Introduce tools: <strong>biomaterials</strong>, <strong>cells</strong>, and <strong>molecular regulators</strong></li>
      <li>Identify cell and molecular targets for treatment </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why It’s Urgent</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>People around the world are living longer, but pain and disability have substantially degraded the quality of their lives and many of them cannot access and/or tolerate surgery </li>
      <li>There are not enough surgeons to meet the needs of patients, globally. 
        <ul>
          <li> Need to provide nonsurgical (injectable) treatments at an earlier stage in the disease process</li>
          <li> Need to include in medical device design process delivery by nonsurgical personnel</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tissue engineering:</strong> in vitro tissue production</li>
      <li><strong>Organ regeneration:</strong> in vivo healing</li>

      <p>And some additional definitions</p>
      <li>Four main cell types: connective, epithelial, muscle, nerve</li>
      <li><strong>Tissue:</strong> A group of cells that have similar make-up and behaviour</li>
      <li><strong>Organ:</strong> A structure comprising two or more tissues</li>
      <li><strong>Engineering:</strong> Making a product using existing knowledge</li>
      <li><strong>Science:</strong> Process of acquiring new knowledge</li>
      <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Means of producing the product</li>
      <li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> <a href="https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  Medical Dictionary
</a></li>
      <li><strong>The human body:</strong>A collection of organs and tissues connected by "connective tissue" and vascular and lympatic systems, and bound to the musculoskeletal system</li>
    </ul>
